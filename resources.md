### Online courses

Online courses are an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to teach programming and computer science in a structured format. As a result, new online courses will pop up all the time, so it's worth checking these resources periodically to see what's new.

- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - offers free coding courses in several different languages. Codeacademy only teaches the basics, so you must work through more tutorials after completing the lessons. The 
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.
- [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.
- [edX](https://www.edx.org/) - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses) - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).
- [Stanford Engineering Everywhere](https://see.stanford.edu/Course) - static course materials taught at Stanford.

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.

- [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) - focuses on web and iOS development
- [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/) - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more
- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - offers courses on thousands of different topics - programming is a heavily covered subject here though

I won't outright say that piracy is a good idea, but almost all of these can be easily downloaded for free using "alternate methods"... I'm just putting it out there.

In general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more difficult thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a simpler introduction to programming intended for beginners. Udemy, Coursera and Udacity are a sort of "middle ground" between the two.
