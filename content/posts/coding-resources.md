# What exactly is programming?
#
**The Beginning**



**How programming is used**

Like I mentioned before in *Defining a program*, programs are made for many different uses, as well as many different devices. And here's where programming comes in. Making a program sounds easy in theory, but in execution we can't do it simply with a pencil and paper. So we need programming languages to help us get the job done instead.

**The history of programming languages**

Believe it or not, the first one was created in 1843! It was made by Ada Lovelace, and was a primitive (by today's standards) machine algorithm.
