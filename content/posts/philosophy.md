# My philosophy (and how it can contribute to yours too!)

**Feature-rich content**

At first, I wanted to make a website with a fancy interface that was filled with pretty visuals, acrylic blur, and tons of colorful code, similar to this Hugo theme I found.

**...or not.**

Because in retrospect it wasn't actually a very good idea. Did I *need* to create a website with an exhiliratingly fresh interface? No. Sure, it'd be cool and might even earn me some brownie points with my tech teacher at school, and all those are actually pretty good points... until I realized that it simply *isn't necessary.* I've got my ideas for what to write in this website, and am typing them on this computer as I think them. I also have a minimalist theme that works pretty well.

**Minmalism instead**

Using a more minimalist approach was the answer, at least in this approach. If it doesn't need to be extremely detailed, then it doesn't - less is more.
