# What exactly is programming?

**Defining a program**

Well, a program is basically just anything that can be coded, like a website, or an app. Programs aren't limited to just computers, though. The App Store is filled with millions of programs, and Google's Play Store is filled with millions more.

**How programming is used**

Like I mentioned before in *Defining a program*, programs are made for many different uses, as well as many different devices. And here's where programming comes in. Making a program sounds easy in theory, but in execution we can't do it simply with a pencil and paper. So we need programming languages to help us get the job done instead.

**The history of programming languages**

Believe it or not, the first one was created in 1843! It was made by Ada Lovelace, and was a primitive (by today's standards) machine algorithm. It's been a thing for so long, and

You may not be interested in this subject at all, and if you aren't, then that's okay - feel free to click off right now and go back to whatever you were doing before. But if you are truly interested in coding and computers, then keep reading the other posts on this site, too. It wasn't meant to be a place where you'd click read the contents and then leave, never to visit again. If my project is successful, at least *one* person will keep coming back to the hub I've made, revisit the links I've scattered throughout it, and hopefully learn even more from them, too.
